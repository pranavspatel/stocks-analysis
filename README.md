# stocks-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is analyze the stocks from the year 2017 and 2018.The goal is to measure the time it take to analyse the data for the year 2017 and 2018. 

The data is of the 12 different stocks and we have to find the closing price, total volume and the return that particular stock gave during the year.

## Result
We found out that the stocks in the year 2017 gave positive returns and majority of the sotcks in the year 2018 gave negative returns. So the year 2018 was not the best time to invest in the stock market.

### Summary

## What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

Refactoring helps us in writing the code in proper structure ,clean and readable code and easy debugging.
On the other hand if the code is too large it becomes difficult to refactor for another type of dataset.

## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The benefit is that the runtime for the analysis can be reduced drastically, it only topok our code around 0.27 seconds to execute.
